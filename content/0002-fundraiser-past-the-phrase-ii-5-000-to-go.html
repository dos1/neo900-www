<p class="lead">We've already reached two out of three milestones in our fundraiser campaign!</p>



<p>Thanks to amazing support from people interested in the project, the <a href="http://neo900.org/#donate">progress bar</a> has reached the level of <strong>15 000 €</strong> in <strong>less than three days</strong> since the start of the campaign. This means we now expect that we should be able to create the schematics, identify componends and do initial mechanical PCB design (phase I) as well as build around five prototypes with basic functionality, such as CPU, display, keyboard and UMTS working (phase II).</p>

<p>We would like to thank all the people who decided that our project follows their interests and donated their money to keep it running. Especially we want to thank everyone who donated less than 100 €, supporting us with anything they could without expecting anything in return. Worth mentioning are also the donors who generously pledged 1 500 € or more, already giving a new home to <strong>three early prototypes</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center">Thank you!</p>

<p>However, our journey is <strong>not over yet</strong>. We still need to collect 5 000 € in order to reach our primary goal and <strong>make the design production ready</strong>. Please <a href="https://shop.goldelico.com/wiki.php?page=Neo900">keep it rolling</a>!</p>

<p>As a sidenote, some people reported problems with rejected credit card transactions or missing "destination country". Please remember that while every donation is appreciated, some automatic creditibility systems may incorrectly mark your donation attempt as a fraud. Please <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=1383775&postcount=1026">follow the instructions</a> in case of any problems and don't try to workaround them by yourself - we'll try to assist you in the process and find individual solutions.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you for your support. Hopefully you'll let us make the next announcement very soon! :)</p>

<p class="lead">The fundraiser reaches 25% of current goal and the hardware evaluation
is in progress.</p>

<p>While the early device as shown in <a href="news-0006-progress-update">the last progress update</a> is being
carefully checked by Joerg and Nikolaus ordered new "upper" PCBs
expected to come in early January, our efforts will obviously slow
down a bit during the next days due to holidays - and while we're at
it, we would like to wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year!</p>

<p>The device counter on <a href="/#donate">our website</a> has reached 250, which is a quarter
of the current goal. While we're above the minimal threshold of 200
(thanks for your support!), we still need as much as we can to make
part sourcing easier, better components possible and the unit price
lower. Maybe the Neo900 pre-order voucher may work as a great Xmas
gift for someone close? :)</p>

<p>We're also working on making our website better. We want to bring more
life into it by adding blog section to make our communication with you
easier and more frequent, and to prepare the site to contain more and
more additional content appearing during the development, like the
article about user privacy in Neo900 which is supposed to be published
soon.</p>

<p>We're thrilled to step into the year 2014 and happy to be able to
bring this project forward, making the final production closer and
closer.</p>

<p>See you next year!</p>

<p>Dear Neo900 supporter,</p>

<p>we would like to update you on the current project status and on
how to move forward. Please read this entire mail, because some
actions are required on your part. These are the topics we cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>heads-up: weak Euro affects total cost,</li>
<li>brief status update and start of materials purchase,</li>
<li>shop opens for pre-orders,</li>
<li>expect a voucher for your loan.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have completed most of the design of the subsystems of Neo900,
and we have tested some critical components. For details, please
follow the links on <a href="http://neo900.org/resources">http://neo900.org/resources</a></p>

<p>As a result, we now know which major components we will want to
use, and we have estimates of whether these components are likely
to be easy to find when we go to production, or whether obtaining
them could become a problem.</p>

<p>The best way to avoid such future problems is to buy "risky" parts
early. To do all this, we need to ask you for a down payment.</p>

<p>We have set up a shop where you will be able to pre-order your NeoN
board or Neo900 device, and where you can make the down payment. A
timely pre-order is especially important if you wish to order a
Neo900 device since we will need to order scarce N900 materials for
them.</p>

<p>We will send you the shop URL with your voucher, see below.</p>

<p>We have also updated the FAQ (<a href="http://neo900.org/faq">http://neo900.org/faq</a>) and we have
added an updated estimate of the total cost of the product:
<a href="http://neo900.org/estimate">http://neo900.org/estimate</a></p>

<p>You will notice that it is higher than what was estimated earlier
in the project. This is in part due to the project turning out to
be more complex than expected, but mainly because the Euro has
depreciated dramatically with respect to the US dollar. This affects
virtually all component prices, which are usually expressed in US
dollars, and also various other costs.</p>

<p>We have written a more detailed analysis here:
<a href="http://neo900.org/exchange">http://neo900.org/exchange</a></p>

<p>We apologize for not notifying you of this increase earlier, but,
truth be told, we did not become aware of the full magnitude of the
change until we made the above cost calculation update. We're sorry
about the price change this has caused, and realize that it may come
as a shock to some, like it did to us.</p>

<p>To return to the pre-orders, the amount of the down payment depends
on which product (NeoN board or Neo900 device) you choose, and how
many. You can deduct the loans ("donations") you have made so far
from the amount of the down payment.</p>

<p>For this purpose, we will send you a voucher (a code) that
corresponds to past payments. We will mail out vouchers over the next
few days. We do this gradually, so that we won't be overwhelmed if
any issues pop up. We will also announce on <a href="http://neo900.org/">http://neo900.org/</a> when
we have sent all the vouchers (this should take about a week).</p>

<p>We thank you for your continued support and we keep on being amazed
by the enthusiasm in this community !</p>

<p>Thank you !</p>

<p>&ndash; The Neo900 team</p>

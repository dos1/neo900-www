<h1>Pre-orders and vouchers</h1>

<h2>Pre-orders</h2>

<p>With a pre-order, you choose how many devices, which kind of device
(NeoN board or assembled Neo900), and which modem configuration
(see <a href="http://neo900.org/faq#networks">http://neo900.org/faq#networks</a> for details) you want.
You can combine choices as you like.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are made through our shop: <a href="https://my.neo900.org/">https://my.neo900.org/</a></p>

<h2>Down payment</h2>

<p>When you place a pre-order, you will be asked to make a down payment.
This down payment is for materials we need to purchase in the coming
months and related expenses. For each NeoN, the down payment is EUR 350.
For each assembled Neo900, it is EUR 480.</p>

<p>Please note that the down payment is a partial payment towards the
final payment. (See below.)</p>

<h2>Vouchers</h2>

<p>If you have given us a loan, you can deduct this loan from the amount
of the down payment. To this end, a voucher code has been included in
this mail.</p>

<p>You can use the voucher code in the shop when placing the pre-order.
The field where you enter the voucher code is labeled "VOUCHERS" and
you find it when you "checkout" and reach the shopping cart page.
The value of the voucher will then be deducted from the price of your
pre-order.</p>

<p>If the value of the voucher exceeds your pre-order, a voucher for the
remaining amount will be automatically generated and mailed to you.</p>

<p>If the voucher you have received in this mail does not match your
loan, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@neo900.org">contact@neo900.org</a></p>

<p>Note: if you made the original loan ("donation") to Golden Delicious
(GDC) and your loan was then transferred to Neo900 UG (or refunded
to you and you then sent it to us), GDC deducted 13% for their own
expenses before the reorganization, but your voucher is over the
original amount and has the date of your original order with GDC.
Example: if you donated EUR 100, then GDC transferred approximately
EUR 86, and your voucher will be over EUR 100.</p>

<h2>E-mail addresses</h2>

<p>If you have made loans from more than one e-mail address, a voucher
will have been sent to each, for the amount loaned from the respective
address. You can use all these vouchers in your order, no matter which
address you use to register at the shop.</p>

<p>If you no longer have access to an e-mail account you used to make a
loan and therefore have not received a voucher, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:contact@neo900.org">contact@neo900.org</a></p>

<h2>Not using a voucher</h2>

<p>If you should choose not to use a voucher at the moment, it will
remain valid, e.g., for the final payment.</p>

<h2>Top-up</h2>

<p>If you wish to make a down payment that exceeds the minimum, you can
do so by ordering the "Down Payment top up" that is shown in the
"ACCESSORIES" sections of the NeoN and Neo900 product pages, then set
the quantity to the desired number of Euros.</p>

<p>We welcome down payments above the minimum. They may enable us to
obtain better conditions for some purchases and to further lower
sourcing risks.</p>

<h2>Loan interest</h2>

<p>As promised, the loans you made will still continue to accrue interest
over their full amount, also if you use your voucher. Please note that
new payments (down payment, top-up, etc.) will not produce interest.</p>

<h2>Future payments</h2>

<p>Please note that this is not the final payment: there will be one more
before we initiate production. Please see our cost calculation for the
estimated total: <a href="http://neo900.org/estimate">http://neo900.org/estimate</a></p>

<p>You will be able to deduct down payment, loan interest, and any
unclaimed vouchers from the final price. Modem choices will slightly
affect the final cost but not the down payment.</p>

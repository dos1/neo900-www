# Slow and Steady

Since joining the Neo900 team, metacollin has been doing a terrific job of
putting together the layouts and has been an undeniable asset for assisting with
KiCad integration. Sadly, that participation has been cut short due to a family
emergency and has been temporarily put on hold.  We expect to be back in motion
shortly after he returns.

We appreciate the understanding and patience of the community and look forward
to making progress during this new year together. Thank you everyone for
believing in this project and helping it come to fruition.

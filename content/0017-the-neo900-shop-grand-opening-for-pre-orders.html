<p>If you have made a loan / donation in the past, you should
    already have received a mail with this information and another
    mail with your voucher code in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>If you have no such mails you may want to check your spam folder
    or contact us at contact@neo900.org. In order to help us find
    your payment record, please provide us with as much information
    as you can, such as:</p>
<ul><li>the date when you made the loan / donation,</li>
<li>the e-mail you used at the time,</li>
<li>how you paid (e.g., bank transfer, PayPal, via GDC refund), and</li>
<li>any payment reference you used.</li></div>

<p>We have completed most of the design of the subsystems of Neo900,
and we have tested some critical components. For details, please
follow the links on <a href="http://neo900.org/resources" target="_blank">resources page</a>.
Some of the highlights:</p>

<p>As a result, we now know which major components we will want to use
and we are about to begin purchasing parts for production - especially
those that have long lead times or that are difficult to find.</p>

<p>In order to make these purchases and also in order to know how
many parts we need to source, and in cases where there are
multiple choices, which variant, we now ask prospective Neo900
owners to place a pre-order and make a down payment.</p>

<p>Pre-orders can be made in our online shop: <a href="https://my.neo900.org/" target="_blank">https://my.neo900.org/</a></p>

<p>We have prepared <a href="http://neo900.org/shop-walk-through/" target="_blank">a walk-through</a> that explains the various steps of
placing a pre-order.</p>

<p>The amount of the down payment depends on whether you choose a NeoN
board, for upgrading your existing N900, or a fully assembled
Neo900. Please note that the down payment is only a partial
payment. We will ask for the final payment before production
starts, which we estimate to be towards the end of this year.</p>

<p>We also have updated our cost estimate, taking into account the
details the R&amp;D work provided. Unfortunately, the total cost of the
NeoN board has increased from the original estimate in 2013, to a
large part due to the weak Euro. This is our latest cost estimate:
<a href="http://neo900.org/estimate" target="_blank">http://neo900.org/estimate</a></p>

<p>We analyze the effect of the Euro to US dollar exchange rate
here:
<a href="http://neo900.org/exchange" target="_blank">http://neo900.org/exchange</a></p>

<p>The above cost estimate is for the NeoN board. The fully assembled
Neo900 will cost approximately EUR 130 more, also plus any applicable
taxes.</p>

<p>Our shop has already been open for a few weeks for supporters who
have already made a donation / loan, and we now invite everyone who
is interested in obtaining a NeoN or Neo900 to make their pre-order.</p>

<p>Please try to place your pre-order before the end of June (2015), so
that we can purchase materials in a timely manner, and especially
while some older parts (N900) we need for compatibility are still
available.</p>

<p>If you have questions or experience difficulties with the shop,
please don't hesitate to contact us at contact@neo900.org or post
in the <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=95482" target="_blank">shop questions thread on talk.maemo.org</a></p>

<p>Thank you, and happy pre-ordering!</p>

<p>- The Neo900 team</p>

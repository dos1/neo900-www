# Neo900 Overview

The design consists of three boards, as shown in the drawing on the
first page of the
[Neo900 IO Expanders](http://neo900.org/stuff/papers/iox.pdf#1)
white paper.

We reuse the case of the Nokia N900, and the shape of LOWER and [BOB]
(Break-Out Board)  
is determined by this. The "bounding box" of LOWER is 106 x 56 mm.

*[BOB]: Break-Out Board

The goal for now is to make what we call the "v2" prototype, where
UPPER can be as large as we like.  
After that, the UPPER for the final product will be similar in shape
to LOWER but a little smaller.

We maintain an [interactive block diagram][B] that illustrates to
which board the various subsystems will go.  
Here is a [snapshot of our schematics][S].  You can download a
[snapshot of the design files][Snap],  
that live in the following repository: <https://neo900.org/git?p=ee>

The final product will have an OMAP DM3730 processor, memories, etc.,  
but for v2 we keep things simple and use a Beagleboard-xM as external
"brain", and  
just implement the peripherals.

We expect the final UPPER to need 8 layers, due to the 515-pin 0.4 mm
BGA of the OMAP.  
UPPER of v2 should be considerably easier. We expect
LOWER to need at least 4, probably 6 layers.  
BOB is simple and 4 layers should be plenty. All boards should be 0.8 mm.

This video shows an earlier prototype (only LOWER, basically just
modem and a few switches):

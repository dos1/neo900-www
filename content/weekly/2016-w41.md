As we're getting closer to the layout for
[proto_v2](/news/neo900-update-2016-09-22), we prepared the following
summary of Neo900 design to describe its structure and mechanical
constraints.  But before that...
{: .lead :}

## Neo900 Freenode Group!

Neo900 is now an official [IRC] group on Freenode!

*[IRC]: Internet Relay Chat

This not only means that we now really "own" all Neo900 related
channels so they are safe from possible "hostile takeovers", we also
may now assign 'cloaks' (virtual hostmasks) to team members and
supporters of the project. A [cloak] is the assigned right part after
"@" of the full username in IRC. So instead of `~jr@123.234.213.231` you
see for example `~jr@neo900/coreteam/joerg` when you do a `/whois
joerg-neo900` or hover over the nickname with the mousepointer.

## Neo900 Design Overview

The design consists of three boards, as shown in the drawing on the
first page of the [Neo900 IO
Expanders](http://neo900.org/stuff/papers/iox.pdf#1) white paper.

We reuse the case of the Nokia N900, and the shape of LOWER and [BOB]
(Break-Out Board) is determined by this. The "bounding box" of LOWER
is 106 x 56 mm.

*[BOB]: Break-Out Board

The goal for now is to make what we call the "v2" prototype, where
UPPER can be as large as we like.  After that, the UPPER for the final
product will be similar in shape to LOWER but a little smaller.

We maintain an [interactive block diagram][B] that illustrates to
which board the various subsystems will go.  Here is a [snapshot of
our schematics][S].  You can download a [snapshot of the design
files][Snap], that live in the following repository:

The final product will have an OMAP DM3730 processor, memories, etc.,
but for v2 we keep things simple and use a Beagleboard-xM as external
"brain", and just implement the peripherals.

We expect the final UPPER to need 8 layers, due to the 515-pin 0.4 mm
BGA of the OMAP.  UPPER of v2 should be considerably easier. We expect
LOWER to need at least 4, probably 6 layers.  BOB is simple and 4
layers should be plenty. All boards should be 0.8 mm.

This video shows an earlier prototype (only LOWER, basically just
modem and a few switches):

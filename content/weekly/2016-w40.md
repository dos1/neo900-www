# BB-xM Unboxing {: #bb-xm-unboxing }

Hooray!  Joerg received another 3 BeagleBoard xM that will be used as
"virtual SoC" for `proto_v2`.  
Six more are coming to complete the stock of 15 announced in the [last
newsletter](https://neo900.org/news/neo900-update-2016-09-22).

Meanwhile, schematics final cleanup and footprint validation are
progressing.  
Tip: we're packing as many LEDs as the chip can offer, which means
**programming LED phun** ahead!

## Time Travel {: #time-travel }

**Updated:** BTW, Joerg received a box with 6 more BB-xM boards.

No, those are [**not these** 6 BB-xM boards][B] that we ordered two
years ago.

Incidentally, the next day we received news from the latter lot [from
Mouser][M], who suffered an obsolescence issue  
with their supplier CircuitCo: apparently [CircuitCo _'forgot'_ they
had discontinued the product][C].

**Good timing!**

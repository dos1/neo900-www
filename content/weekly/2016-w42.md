# Schematics

This week the [ee] repository received the most commits, as Werner and
Joerg are wrapping up the design for the upcoming `proto_v2` layout.
If you want to see the result, you can always check the latest version
of the [schematics] PDF.  In the same directory
(<https://neo900.org/stuff/werner/tmp/ee/pdf/>) you can find older
versions.  If you're feeling brave, you can access all the files
directly from the Git repository, following the instructions in the
[README].

# Updated N900 Image

`parazyd` released [fresh ARM builds] of Devuan and the associated
[test image for the N900][TI].  This is the first step in upcoming
support for Neo900 by the Devuan project.  We've spotted conversations
on `#maemo-ssu` between `parazyd` and `freemangordon`, who takes care
of the [Maemo CSSU] repositories.  Cooperation in free software, as we
like it!

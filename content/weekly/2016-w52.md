`proto_v2` layout under way!  More N900 units!  HackerBus and IR
updates!  Meet at 33c3!
{: .lead :}

## Prototype version 2 Layout 

As expected, work on the `proto_v2` layout started this month, and is
progressing nicely.  The layout is being done by a community member
who is making a special effort to learn how to do her work on free
software, now that we use KiCAD.  It is very telling that we chose a
member of the Neo900 family to bring this prototype to life.  We're
very thankful to `ahycka` for taking up this task.

We also want to thank `ceene` and `atk` for their help in the setup of
the repositories: the layout is a production-ready document that could
impair our company's capacity to reach its goal if an ad-hoc
competitor would decide to take it to a factory without us being
involved.  So, for now, it's top-secret ;o) and only accessible to our
engineering team.  Of course when we're done with it, it will join the
rest of the public code, after all Neo900 is a free hardware project,
and once we have produced your device, we welcome others to make more.

Werner put up a [howto review the
schematics](/stuff/kicad/proto_v2/2016-11-20/review-howto.html) for
those of you who would like to lend an eyeball or two and _make bugs
shallow_.

## Sourcing N900 Units Continues

We received another 40 N900 units to metamorphose them into upgraded
Neo900 devices.  That makes about 140 Neo900 devices in the making.
We still need to source 75 to cover our current demand (not counting
the 114 NeoN boards ordered by people who already own a N900), and
another 450 to reach our end goal of 800 Neo900 produced.  Sourcing
N900 is a slow and hard process (they need to be in mint condition),
so if you find any, pass the word!  Kids, beware: we've spotted one
recently pulled by Krampus:

## Hackerbus, IR, and Buttons

Soon after our last news in November, the [Hackerbus whitepaper][hb]
was updated with the following changes:

- `GPIO_d` now uses configurable `VAUX3` as supply, not a fixed 2.7 V
  rail
- documented alternative Hackerbus pin assignment

[hb]: /stuff/papers/hb.pdf

A couple of days ago, the [InfraRed Whitepaper][ir] was updated with
the following changes:

- the IR logic is now controlled through an I2C-accessible register in
  the logic chip (Silego), not through GPIOs
- the receiver is designed to filter at 30 Hz, not 10 Hz
- added slew rate control for the transmit LED
- added an analog switch to completely disable the receiver

Finally, Joerg is reverse-engineering the Enhanced Interface Control
(ECI) of N900 (which is also present in Neo900) and started
documenting it.  That means we can have free software to control
undocumented features of Nokia hardware that wasn't used before, and
our friends from Maemo are on it!  Joerg posted some very [technical
details on IRC][d].

## Are You Going To 33c3?

If you're going to the Chaos Communications Congress next week and
want to have a friendly chat about Neo900, hellekin will be around,
joinable on the GSM network.  We'll update this page with more
information so that we can setup a meeting!

## What's next?

In 2017, as soon as the `proto_v2` is out we'll launch a new
crowdfunding campaign to help us reach out to more people and reach
our objective.  In that context, Neo900 will be present at the
[Conference on Privacy and Data Protection] in Brussels, end of
January.  This is the most important conference on the topic in
Europe, gathering professionals and researchers from around the world.
More on this later!

The Neo900 team wish you a great celebration for this end of year.

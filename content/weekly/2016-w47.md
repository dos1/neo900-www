`proto_v2` schematics ready for peer review!  
Should you buy a new phone or wait for Neo900?  
Why does Maemo need to change?

## Neo900 Prototype version 2: Last Call for Review

On November 8, 2016, the [`proto_v2`
schematics](/stuff/kicad/proto_v2/2016-11-08/Neo900__proto_v2.pdf)
were updated to the current version.  We finished the last few
improvements and our layouter is scheduling the layout to start in one
week.  We repeat our invitation to give the schematics a peer review:
it's your last chance to peel your eyes on these schematics and be
picky about details that our engineering team might have missed.
Hopefully you won't find anything, but as Joerg says:

> I've learned to be humble and not do fortune telling.

We expect that during the layout phase more options for improvements
will be found (and integrated), and that some modifications will
happen that won't change the functionality but affect the schematics,
e.g., rearranging pins that turn out to be disadvantageous, and so on.

### Next Steps

The layout phase will begin next week, and should be ready in time to
start the production of about 10 boards before the end of the year.
Some of these prototypes will be handed to selected developers from
the community for testing.  We hope for this to happen before February
2017.  In parallel the engineering team will start with integrating
the CPU on the NeoN board itself for next (and - with luck - final)
prototype; during the testing phase, probably a month, they will
integrate fixes for any issues that may arise from testing the
`proto_v2` boards.

#### Layout Phase

The layout is the drawing that shows where components, copper (and
more) will go on the PCB.  This represents the exact geometry of the
result, and can be used to produce the board.  In KiCad, the layout
can be made using `pcbnew`.  Once the layout is ready, we can start
producing the PCBs.

#### PCB Production

PCB production comes in three phases: first the bare board
manufacture, without any components; then the assembly where the
components are soldered to the PCB.  Once the _cooking_ part is done,
each board needs to be tested for compliance with the design: booting,
flashing, automated runs of programs, etc.

#### Prototype Assembly

We're almost there: the boards come back to us from the _fab_ in
working condition, or so they say :).  We run a few more dozens of
tests, visual, and mechanical checks, before assembling them within
the case and connect the BB-xM that serves at _external CPU_ during
this prototype phase.  We run more tests, package them, and ship them
to our esteemed developers.

#### Developer Tests

Our volunteers run tests, install OSes and programs, boot, flash, and
use the prototype, and report to us anything that might come up at
this point.  Hopefully no or only minor defects are detected and can
be fixed.  Then after a month we know whether we can safely step to
the next prototype...

### Prototype Version 3

As soon as `proto_v2` is ready, we'll kickstart a Spring crowdfunding
to ramp up pre-orders to enter the "economic zone", that is the point
where we have enough orders to make the production doable without
running into debt.  Currently that's 800 units.  Get ready to share
the love: your help convincing others will help the project succeed
beyond expectations.

The third prototype is the release candidate.  If all goes well with
`proto_v2` and no unexpected delays occur until then, it will take us
about 3 months to follow the same process and produce `proto_v3`.  At
this point the final production is nigh, and we hope for the first run
of Neo900 to start in time for Fall 2017.

As always with delays, we cannot really set dates in stone (that's
what global corporations do because they have the workforce and
capital to bend time to their will.)

<!--

08:54 <Joerg-Neo900> zxss: yes, specs are pretty much locked down
09:50 <user__> Joerg-Neo900, would you say the phone will be ready within 2 years?
09:53 <Joerg-Neo900> I very much think and hope so, however I've learned to be humble and not do fortune telling
09:58 <Joerg-Neo900> right now the *plan* is to start building proto_v2 this year, we are negotiating with several layouters, trying to get the process started (originally, aka 10 months ago, the plan was that Nikolaus would do the layout and we could already deliver now. Alas this changed in unforeseeable ways). You _always_ run into nasty surprises like a layouter offering "1 to 2 weeks for doing the job", then when you negotiate with them, it's suddenly 6 months
09:58 <Joerg-Neo900> instead of 2 weeks
10:02 <Joerg-Neo900> what doesn't help either is the fact that Neo900 UG isn't a huge company that can hire and fire and rely on employees doing their job, we need subcontractors and we don't have a network of reliable ones yet, so we need ro build such network aka find people who can do the jobs in a reliable way
10:08 <saper> in other words, don't hold your breath
10:09 <Joerg-Neo900> the utopia plan would be: in 3 weeks we got the layout for proto_v2, in 8 weeks the ready built proto_v2 hardware (some 10 boards), then we send out those to the community software developers and them and us start evaluating/testing those proto_v2 for a 4 weeks and don't find major issues. Same time we start a kickstarter based on those proto_v2 to show off, to ramp up the number of preorders to the economic zone. So in 12 weeks we could start
10:09 <Joerg-Neo900> layout and building of proto_v3 (release candidate), and in 16 to 18 weeks we could start final sales and production
10:10 <Joerg-Neo900> this plan is not very likely to come true, we *always* seen that the unforeseen delays are the major factor determining how long any step takes
10:11 <Joerg-Neo900> so, no matter the honesty of the numbers I gave above, this won't happen
10:13 <Joerg-Neo900> nevertheless we try hard to make it happen exactly according to this schedule, even when we have to accept that it's not possible to keep the deadlines
10:18 <Joerg-Neo900> just one 'funny' little story to illustrate: I ordered a 6 BeagleBoard-xM almost 2 years ago, for the proto_v2, at mouser. They postponed delivery by another 2 months on a regular basis each time the shipping date came near, since ComponentCo (maker of BB-xM) didn't deliver to Mouser. Until a 3 weeks ago they finally announced the BB-xM isn't available anymore. Luckily exactly same time I finally made to source 2nd hand BB-xM from USA and UK,
10:18 <Joerg-Neo900> thanks to ravelo (community member) who helped a damn lot with that
10:21 <Joerg-Neo900> status right now: we're honestly ready to start proto_v2 layout, and that *should* not take any longer than 4 man weeks til completion, for the mere layout and associated tasks. Then producing the proto boards should be relatively straight and manageable a task
10:23 <Joerg-Neo900> I hope this helps to give some insight into our current status and planning
10:24 <Joerg-Neo900> as much as I'd like to, I can't give any more binding, more precise prognosis
10:25 <Joerg-Neo900> I just can tell a 100% sure how long it will take *at least* until production start
10:25 <Joerg-Neo900> see above
10:29 <user__> Joerg-Neo900, do you mean "in 16 to 18 weeks" after 12 weeks (making it 28-30 weeks total) or you mean 16-18 weeks in total?
10:30 <Joerg-Neo900> that was total, based on adding the schedules in that explanation. But again, this is utopia
10:30 <user__> so we should expect 5x that
10:30 <Joerg-Neo900> I don't dare to speculate on that
10:30 <user__> i see
10:31 <Joerg-Neo900> since if that was a honest way to estimate, I'd already had done it
10:31 <user__> well i'll probably get a oneplus 3 in the meantime i guess
10:31 <user__> if utopia happens i'll just sell it
10:32 <Joerg-Neo900> probably pragmatic plan to handle tings

## FSF's RYF Program

The Free Software Foundation is well-known to be picky about user's
privacy.  Their [Respects Your Freedom] program

[Respects Your Freedom]: http://fsf.org/ryf


10:32 <user__> Joerg-Neo900, has richard stallman or anyone from the FSF commented on neo900?
10:32 <Joerg-Neo900> i'm sorry I can't promise anything more cheerful
10:32 <Joerg-Neo900> several times, yes
10:33 <Joerg-Neo900> I had an email conversation with RMS just less than 2 weeks ago, I still hope to receive a reply to my last email
10:35 <user__> Joerg-Neo900, he is usually adamntly against mobile phones, have you managed to convince him to use neo900?
10:35 <Joerg-Neo900> basically it boils down to RMS trying to ignore out of existence the fact that *every* legally certified modem module has a firmware in flash storage that per consequence from regulations isn't alterable by user but of course is always updateable by manufacturer in either documented or secret ways
10:37 <Joerg-Neo900> even if we could build a modem with FOSS firmware that is alterable by user, as required by FSF rules, such modem would be illegal to use outside an anechoic chamber
10:38 <Joerg-Neo900> likewise there's no way to make sure the firmware is not updateable by manufacturer, since we can't look inside the module and see what can and what can't get done. We only have the docs of manuf we may or may not trust in
10:39 <Joerg-Neo900> a basic truth is: flash storage is flashable :-)
10:39 <Joerg-Neo900> and no modem will use One-Time-Programmable storage for their firmware
10:41 <Joerg-Neo900> also note that all this "firmware not updateable" requirements are *ONLY* to allow FSF/RMS to ignore the fact that there _is_ software involved in this blackbox. It has not other purpose at all
10:43 <Joerg-Neo900> what can I say... in the end of the day it's Free *SOFTWARE* Foundation, and they are not _really_ in a position (nor obviously do they have the expertise needed) to judge on HARDWARE design quality
10:45 <Joerg-Neo900> our hardware design is as open and user friendly as it possibly gets. What you do with it and thus if FSF is happy with it or not (which both relates to, or is determined by, the SOFTWARE used on the hardware) is not on us to decide on or have a major saying in
10:47 <Joerg-Neo900> as soon as some brilliant community member finds a way to flash a new user defined firmware on the 'blackbox' chips, suddenly the hardware was fulfilling FSF's wildest dreams
10:51 <Wizzup> Joerg-Neo900: again, this as a post on the web would be cool (your not-quite-fortune telling remark and what follows)
10:51 <Joerg-Neo900> we seen that with Openmoko Freerunner. First it been FSF endorsed/compliant since there was no known way for user to update the modem firmware. Then I finally published a modem firmware bugfix update and thus any FSF approval got moot. And then eventually the Osmocom folks published OsmocomBB - an experimental flaky but FOSS firmware for the Freerunner's calypso modem - and suddenly Frerunner was FSF compliant again, more than ever. All the
10:51 <Joerg-Neo900> time the *hardware* didn't change at all
10:52 <Joerg-Neo900> Wizzup: I agree wholeheartedly, alas I'm not the guy updating the website. Maybe we can discuss it with how900/hellekin

## Neo900 Operating System
### Or Why Maemo Needs to Change?

Maemo is the recommended OS for Neo900.  It's based on Debian, and was
the original system for the Nokia N900.  Since Nokia abandoned ship
and turned to proprietary software, the Maemo community took over.

Maemo pre-dates the mandatory use of `systemd` in Debian and has
relevant core functionality that depend on `cgroups`, a Linux kernel
functionality.  As Debian depends more and more on `systemd`
integration, it will drift away from Maemo as it is now, especially
with regard to minimum system requirements that would someday forbid
to install it on our hardware.

`/bin` and `/sbin` were traditionally used to include thoses binaries
required by the system at boot, before mounting any other filesystem
partitions, e.g., in `/usr`.  That limited the extent of disk space
required by the minimal system, and allowed to mount extra software
from another partition.  But the recent decision to merge these two
directories under `/usr` means either an inflated root partition of
several gigabytes, or duplication of the executables in mounted
overlays after the system has booted.  From our perspective, that
rules out Debian for typical embedded systems where you only have
between 128MB and a _huge_ 1GB of root NAND storage to boot from.
(For comparison N900 has 256MB of RAM, and Neo900 has 1GB.)

As we're striving for minimalism and long term support of the
recommend OS, we've been discussing these issues with the Maemo
community and the Devuan community.  What's coming to the horizon is
that Maemo will switch upstream from Debian to Devuan, the Debian fork
without `systemd`.  This way, we get the best of both worlds:
continuity for Maemo development, and a default OS based on Devuan for
mobiles!

We must thank _freemangordon_ and _Pali_ on the Maemo side, and
_parazyd_ on the Devuan side for making this possible.  Heads up!
These are free software projects, and you are welcome to participate:
both the Fremantle Porting Task Force (`Pali`, `Freemangordon` aka
Ivo, and others) as well as the [Devuan project](https://devuan.org/)
need more active developers to help with those very important tasks.

## Should I just buy a new phone or wait for neo900?

The specifications were made two years ago and to some it may sound
old already, given the pace at which the industry offers new features.
That's certainly a valid point of view if you're looking for the
latest gizmos.  But Neo900 still has features you won't find in these
mainstream smartphones &mdash; nor any other phone that we know of
(see also the recent article by Tor developer Mike Perry on [Future
Work: Baseband Analysis (and
Isolation)](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/mission-improbable-hardening-android-security-and-privacy).

If you want to compare Neo900 to anything else, you'd rather pick its
category of smartphones: like Hoox M2 or the Cryptophone 500.  Both
try to address similar issues with privacy and security, however, only
Neo900 combines both a free hardware design, and a hardware approach
to modem isolation, among other things.

If you need a smartphone right now, you might want to pick one up
readily, and sell it when we're ready.  But of course we build to
order and not for the shelf, so there won't probably be any devices
for sale on the free market anytime soon.  Hence we'd rather secure
your order now, so if you have the cash and didn't pre-order one
already, please, [go ahead and support Neo900]: every pre-order
reinforces the project, every donation helps us and boosts our
confidence that we can deliver free hardware to free people.

## Use your Neo900 as a thermometer

Silego seems they want to discontinue SLG46531, for the supposed
replacement we have fun with [SLG46537]. Revision 100 has a
"temperature sensor" unlike the preliminary [revision 051].

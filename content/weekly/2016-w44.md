Yet another spooky October week: power, flexibility, URL loss,
debacle...  Well, almost ;o).  
Must be the season...

## Neo900 Power Tree Grew Up

"The [power tree] looks perfect", Joerg said.  The power tree shows
the distribution of electricity in the system.

Our current draft for the power tree in `proto_v2` still has
specificity for the BB-xM assembly (since that acts as external CPU
for testing the prototype), yet it anticipates the final design, so we
can ensure the components can already be put in the right places.

### BB-xM Connection to `proto_v2`

Connecting the BeagleBoard-xM was [not obvious] though.  At first
Joerg and Werner considered using [FPC]. Then Joerg remembered the
Sony NT-1 digital audio cassette recorder from 1994, that used a flex
PCB folded 4 times to fit the case! `o_O`

[![NT-1 audio recorder](/stuff/random/news-2016-w44-nt1.jpg)](http://maemo.cloud-7.de/share-service/20120509_004.jpg)

Then they decided a [ribbon cable] would do the job just fine, without
all the weirdness, and added difficulty and costs.

This draft illustrates [how BB-xM and `proto_v2`][draft] will be
placed with respect to each other; notice how the UPPER PCB extends
far beyond the rear of the case and connects to the BB-xM.  This is
how we build `proto_v2` to use BB-xM instead of the embedded SoC.

## Buh-bye horrible URLs

OK, we did it: no more terrible `QUERY_STRING` URLs in our public Git
repositories that where unreadable, hard to remember, and hardly
pastable.  Now everything looks like it's made to last:

- before: https://neo900.org/git/?p=misc;a=tree;f=meme
- after: <https://neo900.org/git/misc/tree/meme>

Redirections are not in place yet, so if you find an old URI that's
broken please blame **how900** on Freenode and it will be fixed soon.

Oh, and we [ditched] `Gitweb` for `CGit`, killing one stone with two
angry birds.

## Eeplot Debacle!

W. Martin Borgert (AKA. 'debacle' ;o) [opened a wishlist bug][bug] to
the Debian BTS to package [eeshow], Werner's "Schematics renderer and
viewer for KiCad".  His "justification for packaging" is a nice praise
for `Eeplot`:

> Eeplot fills a gap: So far I was not able to produce a searchable
PDF with KiCad, because it always made plotted lines from text. Eeplot
does it right!

Praise _debacle_ :D

## There are News and News

In the last couple of months we've been experimenting with
publications to find our marks in delivering timely, updated,
interesting, sometimes humorous contents (or vice-versa) and keeping
you informed of the development of the Neo900.  It's not always easy
to ponder what's newsworthy and what's not, and how to convey the
spirit of Neo900 as well as noteworthy 'events'.

So far we only had _news_ hard-coded into our website.  Lately I've
been trying to find balance and distinguish several types of 'news':

- _weekly updates_ on Neo900 development, that are short summaries of
  current events (like this one)

- _discoveries_ about my personal EE n00b view trying to understand
  what our great engineering team is doing, thanks to their patience
  and will to share knowledge (like [that one])

- and longer, more _in-depth articles_ addressing Neo900 labs research
  and the Neo900 features and market. E.g., the [ASN.1 vulnerability].

So in the coming weeks and months I'll restructure the website to
reflect this undercurrent dialogue informing experts and profanes
alike on the pulse actualizing Neo900.

Thank you for your attention,

hellekin for the Neo900 team

<p class="lead">Time for some news about what's going on in the project - phase V reached, dual-touch support, new test boards, discussions about user privacy and more!</p>

<h4>Funding campaign</h4>

<p>A few hours after publishing <a href="news-0005-phase-i-results-ohsw-showcase">our last update</a>, the counter on the website
reached the magic number - 200, causing the transition <a target="_blank" href="/#donate">from phase IV
to phase V</a>! Thank you once again! This means that the current goal is
to reach at least 1&nbsp;000 customers wanting to ensure that they'll get
the device from first production batch. The closer we are to reaching it, the
easier are some components to get (like <a target="_blank" href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/neo900/issues/516/">1 GB RAM chip, with minimum
order quantity of 1&nbsp;000 units</a>) and the cheaper every single device will become. Right
now we're at about 235 devices. Please spread the word about Neo900 -
everyone benefits from that counter reaching a high value!</p>

<h4>New features</h4>

<p>In other news, we're happy to announce that Neo900 hardware is <a target="_blank" href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/neo900/issues/527/">going
to support dual-touch gestures</a> like rotating and pinching, without
replacing the original, resistive screen from N900! Though we originally planned to see if we can implement this principle with
discrete components, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=CRTOUCH&nodeId=0112698268">the chip</a> that has been suggested by user wentknweqt_ on IRC allowed us to greatly simplify our design. Thanks! You can read more about how it works in <a target="_blank" href="http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=1393889&postcount=1473">Joerg's TMO post</a>.</p>

<h4>News from our R&D department</h4>

<p>We've made some progress on <a target="_blank" href="http://download.goldelico.com/neo900/images/images.php#2013:12:10">our proto-boards</a>. We have finalized one
PHS8-P based set of boards, featuring the LEDs to test keyboard
illumination. We will also use the boards to run further tests - voice calls (with analog audio for initial testing), GPS and keyboard itself. Our next step will be to do a redesign of the boards based on <a target="_blank" href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/neo900/issues/518/">all
experiences</a> (e.g. moving some holes and components by 0.1 - 0.5 mm)
and to add more functionality for the next round of engineering tests.
We expect to have something more to test in January.</p>

<h4 id="more">Issues and a request for help</h4>

<p>Side by side with nice successes there also always come some inevitable problems, always
willing to arrive at least expected places (Murphy's Law, ยง42). Our biggest headache
right now is <a target="_blank" href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/neo900/issues/536/">Molex 5000246471 connector</a> (used to connect the display
part) which is officially obsolete since Feb 2013. We're also looking
for complete N900s in good quality (though possibly with broken mainboard) as well for as sources for spare parts. We'd
  like to kindly ask our community for a little bit of help there -
  especially for sourcing the display connector. If you know some way to
  help, please <a href="contact">contact us</a>!</p>
  
  <h4>Privacy and FSF approval</h4>
  
  <p>In the past few days we've seen many questions from users concerned about
  their privacy when using the Neo900, coming also from FSF-related people
  and even Mr. Richard Stallman himself. The Neo900 is very likely going to be the
  best phone you can find to take care about protecting your privacy, but we'd like to clarify that
  while we share the spirit behind Free Software Foundation and their consumer
  privacy concerns, and our design takes into consideration majority of
  their recommendations, there are some differences in our approach where we disagree with FSF and
  we believe that in fact our concept is better for user privacy and freedom than
  what FSF suggests.</p>
  
  <p>We are going to use Neo900 too and we are as concerned about our
  own privacy as many of our users are about theirs. Therefore, in next few days
  we're going to publish a comprehensive article about our views on this
  topic, clarifying in detail why exactly our views differ from FSF
  point of view and what we are going to offer instead - information
  that's currently spread across various IRC logs, e-mails and forum posts. Stay
  tuned!</p>
  
  <h4>GTA04A5 campaign</h4>
  
  <p>Last but not least: our sister project, <a target="_blank" href="http://gta04.org/">GTA04</a>, started <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.goldelico.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04A5">the fundraiser</a>
  for producing new revision of this Openmoko Neo Freerunner replacement
    board - <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.goldelico.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04A5">GTA04A5</a>, enhancing some stuff and fixing a few minor issues
    found in earlier revisions. The campaign has already collected 1&nbsp;930
    EUR for 16 devices and is now heading for 5&nbsp;000 EUR, which would
    translate into 50 units.
    If you're interested in upgrading your Freerunner or getting a whole
    device, <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.goldelico.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04A5">pre-order now</a>! You can also order used Neo Freerunner now and get a rebate on GTA04 when it's ready. The success of GTA04 campaign
    will also positively influence the Neo900 project, as both boards
    share the majority of their components.</p>
    
<p>Thank you for tremendous support and interest we've received so far
    and see you in next update!</p>

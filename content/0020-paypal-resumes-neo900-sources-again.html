<p class="lead">After <a href="/news/paypal-trouble-delays-project">6 months of PayPal 
trouble</a> the situation has been sorted. Neo900 has resumed buying 
components for the upcoming production run.</p>

<h3>PayPal Unfreezes Neo900 Account</h3>

<p>This is good news!  Thanks to your continued donations through PayPal, we 
have accumulated there $$.  Since last September our assets were frozen (the 
"WikiLeaks Syndrome") as our "case" was going through a Kafkaiesque process 
that finally ended XX/XX/XXXX.</p>

<p class="todo">See Maemo Talk for info about PP. <a

<h3>Component Sourcing Resumes</h3>

<p>Right after PayPal unlocked your contributions, we could resume buying 
components to build the new boards.</p>

<h3>Incoming: 250 N900</h3>

<p>Thanks to our dear correspondent in China, Xiangfu, put a hand on a stock 
of 250 N900 units we can use to metamorphose into the Neo900.  That amounts 
to xx% of our needs.  If you know where to find some affordable stocks, 
please <a href="mailto:contact@neo900.org?Subject=N900 Stock">contact 
us</a>!</p>

<h3>Hello Neo900 Community!</h3>

<p>This article was brought to you by hellekin, who joined the team to
facilitate communication with you.</p>

<p>I was called to join the Neo900 to relieve our dears inventors from the
public relations tasks, and let them focus on the technical and
operational side of the project.</p>

<p>I'm not a PR professional, but a long time free software activist and
accidental coder.  A member of the Dyne.org Foundation, my activity
covers a diversity of projects ranging from system administration to web
development and community building.  I participate in a few free
software projects such as Tomb and Dowse.  I also volunteer time to the
GNU project in the webmasters team and with the GNU consensus project to
coordinate development of free social software.</p>

<p>Last August at CCCamp15, I was softly coerced into accepting a N900
phone from Werner with the hope I would go back a week later to Buenos
Aires and hand him the device for dissection.  Allow me to apologize for
not having given it back yet and perharps slighty slowed down Neo900
development (but not as much as PayPal).</p>

<p>You see, my last phone ended up dying slowly on the roof of a random bar in Paris, sometimes in 1999.  My friends had been harrasing me to get one, then 
harrassing me for not answering it, and finally stopped complaining when they learned I had no phone anymore.  Go figure.  I was happy with the situation until 
Camp.</p>

<p>You can imagine how an inexperienced user who didn't follow the
evolution of _smartphone_ technologies since before <abbr
title="Year 2000">Y2K</abbr> can build expectations about a phone.  I
had mine: it should be flat, multitouch and HD, about the size of a
Galaxy S10, and of course free hardware, the only way the user can
ensure the phone is not spying on them.</p>

<p>Interruption and built-in privacy wiper were the two main blockers for me
to get a phone again.  I was still waiting for my dream phone.</p>

<p>My lack of experience with <em>smartphones</em> make me an excellent
guinea pig for user interfaces.  My friends can't stop wondering when
they see me fail at using their device for simple tasks.  But if you
wonder how a clueless person can handle tech talk about phones and
communicate for Neo900, here comes a little context.</p>

<p>I had been curious about free hardware since I met S&eacute;bastien 
Bourdeauducq in the <code>/tmp/lab</code> hackerspace near Paris.  We share 
some fun memories of making an ad-hoc street demo of MilkyMist One in 
Amsterdam.  The OpenMoko project was great and the Neo design attractive, 
although a bit clumsy to handle and the display too small. So I kept 
waiting.</p>

<p>When Werner introduced me to the Neo900, I stubbornly dismissed it for 
the form factor.  Although it brought to life my desire for an Internet 
device built on free hardware and free software, I could resist the 
tentation to crave this <em>slider</em> with a ridiculy small keyboard: I'm 
not a thumb-writer!  So when Werner sneakily handed me an N900, via my 
partner, to "keep in touch during the camp", at a moment most vulnerable as 
I was leaving my angel shit in the kitchen, circumspection had me.</p>

<p>Long story short: I've been traveling to 4 countries lately and have 6 
SIM cards in a little box.  Using the keyboard to SSH into a remote machine 
or editing text isn't as bad as I expected.  I still prefer my full-size 
keyboard but I took some notes on the N900, and it's great for ad-hoc 
interventions on a server.</p>

<p>Having passed this barrier to usage, I'm eager to see what the hardware 
upgrade to Neo900 can bring in terms of performance.  The N900 falls a bit 
short and shows its age.</p>

<p>But more importantly, and this is why Neo900 has a special place in my 
heart, it's the only phone that provides a hardware protection from remote 
activation of the baseband chip.  Even a secure phone like the Cryptophone, 
besides not being free, cannot prevent the baseband chip from requesting 
power on its own, because it's using stock hardware, and all commercial 
phones (I know of) connect the baseband chip directly to the power, without 
CPU intervention, hence without any control from the <abbr title="Operating 
System">OS</abbr>.  With the Neo900, you are free to choose whether this 
pesky lurker _needs_ access aaato your phone's radio or not.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention,</p>

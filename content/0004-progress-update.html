<p class="lead">After unexpectedly successful launch of our fundraiser, the project is
progressing well.</p>

<p>Thanks to amazing support from our community we're already
<a href="news-0003-we-ve-reached-our-goal">past the first three phases of our fundraiser</a>, reaching our first,
monetary goal. Thank you! However, now we need to ensure that we'll be
able to sell at least 200 devices, as that's the amount we've been
using in our price calculations and feasibility evaluation. We assume
that all donors pledging 100 â‚¬ or more will want to use their rebate
on finished device, so we count them as our customers. At this moment
we only need 50 more potential Neo900 owners to go!</p>

<p>Of course the fundraiser is not the only thing happening in the
project. The fundraiser kept us so busy that we failed to publish
a new newsletter more timely, even though there're lots of stuff to
report on. We've already designed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXlQLMzFqcc">first prototype PCB</a> and <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=1387162&postcount=1259">ordered
it</a>, hoping to demonstrate the modem's functions (data, voice, GPS) and mechanical integration into the N900 case 
on first real hardware coming from this project at <a href="http://ohsw.org/">Open Hard- and
Software Workshop</a> in Garching (Munich), Germany, taking place
30. Nov - 1. Dec 2013. For those of you who cannot appear there
in person we're going to provide YouTube live stream from the event.
Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Some people were wondering how the battery hotswap feature is going to
look like. Joerg has prepared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ta7Mh9a_y8">a short video clip</a> showing amazingly
easy battery replacement procedure. The Neo900 is going to be designed
in such a way that replacing battery will be possible without turning
it off, even without attaching external power from USB!</p>

<p>Our web page is constantly getting some layout and content
improvements. One of the most frequently asked questions was about the
openness and freedom of the device and how we're going to reach our
goals regarding user privacy with blackbox modem module. The answers
are now available at <a href="http://neo900.org/faq#floss">our FAQ page</a>.</p>

<p>We would also like to announce that <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=1387111&postcount=1256">we plan to publish EAGLE
project files</a>, allowing everyone with enough time, skills and money
to improve on our work and do their own hardware modifications on the
mainboards. This would make Neo900 the only phone available on the
market with such degree of openness!</p>

<p>Our community is also progressing with their tasks - <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=91308">the Fremantle
Porting Task Force project</a> recently managed to boot Maemo 5 with
recent version of Linux kernel (3.12) and came up with reverse
engineered version of MCE daemon, responsible for controlling some
peripherals of N900, bringing the project few steps closer to provide
working Fremantle system on platforms like Neo900.</p>

<p>Thanks for following this project and stay tuned for more!</p>

    <p class="lead">
      A recent vulnerability disclosure threatens billions of
      smartphones.  What's the fuss about it?  How does Neo900 fare
      against this threat?  Hint: pretty well.
    </p>

    <h1 id="asn1-vulnerability">ASN.1 Vulnerability</h1>

    <p>Following the decision of <abbr title="National Institute for
      Standards and Technology">NIST</abbr> to deprecate usage of SMS
      in two-factor authentication, this vulnerability disclosure
      confirms the pertinence of the unique design of Neo900 that,
      among other features, isolates the baseband chip (modem), making
      it dependent on the <abbr title="Central Processing
      Unit">CPU</abbr> (and the <abbr title="Operating
      System">OS</abbr>) to access anything else on the system, and
      preventing remote activation of the chip in the first place.</p>

    <p>Lucas Molas of <em>Programa STIC</em> discovered a <q>Heap
      memory corruption in <abbr title="Abstract Syntax Notation
      One">ASN.1</abbr> parsing code generated by Objective Systems
      Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++</q> potentially affecting
      billions of phone users worldwide.
      <q cite="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/asn1/Pages/Application-fields-of-ASN-1.aspx">
	<abbr>ASN.1</abbr> is used in many protocols and data formats,
	including cellular telephony.</q>
      The proprietary software vendor received a bug report
      via <em>plain text email</em> on June, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2016,
      according to
      the <a href="https://github.com/programa-stic/security-advisories/tree/master/ObjSys/CVE-2016-5080/">CVE-2016-5080</a>
      released on July, 18<sup>th</sup>, 2016 to the public in a
      coordinated release with the vendor.</p>

     <blockquote>Abstract Syntax Notation One (<abbr>ASN.1</abbr>) is
       a technical standard and formal notation that describes rules
       and structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and
       decoding data in telecommunications and computer
       networking.</blockquote>

     <blockquote>A vulnerability found in the runtime support
       libraries of the ASN1C compiler for C/C++ from Objective
       Systems Inc. could allow an attacker to remotely execute code
       in software systems, including embeded software and firmware,
       that use code generated by the ASN1C compiler. The
       vulnerability could be triggered remotely without any
       authentication in scenarios where the vulnerable code receives
       and processes <abbr>ASN.1</abbr> encoded data from untrusted
       sources, these may include communications between mobile
       devices and telecommunication network infrastructure nodes,
       communications between nodes in a carrier's network or across
       carrier boundaries, or communication between mutually untrusted
       endpoints in a data network.</blockquote>

     <p>The proprietary software vendor released a hot patch (v7.0.1)
       available upon request to their customers, and will integrate the
       fix in the upcoming v7.0.2 of their compiler.</p>

     <p>On July, 1<sup>st</sup>, Programa STIC mentioned
       that <q>memory corruption bugs in <abbr>ASN.1</abbr> related
       components of an <abbr title="Long Term Evolution">LTE</abbr>
       stack have been announced or hinted at in several infosec
       conference presentations over the past few weeks and its (sic)
       likely the same or similar bugs will become public
       soon.</q></p>

     <h2>How is Neo900 Affected?</h2>

<!--     <p>The short answer is: although the modem in Neo900 may or may
       not be affected--we cannot know since <strong>all baseband
       chips are proprietary black box designs</strong>--Neo900 is
       designed to not trust the modem.</p>
-->
     <p>The short answer is: even if the modem in Neo900 were
     compromised, it couldn't spread infection to the rest of the
     system like it would on most smartphones.  To know why, read on.</p>

    <p>In
       our <a href="https://neo900.org/news/paypal-resumes-neo900-sources-again">last
       communication</a> we noted that <strong>Neo900 is the only
       phone that provides a hardware protection from rogue behavior
       of the modem</strong>.</p>

    <p id="anchor-gta0x">In fact, the
      <a href="#note-gta0x"><strong>GTA0x</strong> design</a> contains
      two unique features to detect and/or prevent suspect activity:
      <ul>
        <li>the modem is detached from the power source, unlike other
          smartphones, so that the modem has to be authorized by
          the <abbr>CPU</abbr> before it can perform its tasks.</li>
        <li>the modem and the <abbr>CPU</abbr> <strong>do not share
          <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr></strong>, which
          prevents a whole range of attack vectors where a rogue
          modem, either by design, by "lawful", or by illegal action,
          could take control of memory segments pertaining to other
          subsystems and inject malicious code.</li>
      </ul>
      Neo900 takes advantage of this and incorporates circuitry to
      give the <abbr>CPU</abbr> the capacity to monitor:
      <ul>
        <li>the modem access to power and its consumption</li>
        <li>the activity of the modem antenna</li>
        <li>the activation of the
          <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>
          part of the modem</li>
        <li>other interfaces (e.g., digital
          <abbr title="Pulse-Code Modulation">PCM</abbr> audio</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Therefore this vulnerability that potentially plagues most
       commercial phones on the planet, won't affect Neo900 like it
       will other devices. In other designs where RAM is shared and a
       rogue modem can access the power supply at will, the attack
       surface is infinitely larger, and exploiting a vulnerability
       such as the <abbr>ASN.1</abbr> bug will grant access to the
       whole system.</p>

    <p>But with Neo900, the attack surface is much reduced, and a
      compromised modem would only to subvert the <abbr>CPU</abbr> in
      the presence of subsequent major vulnerabilities. As long as
      there's no proprietary vulnerable binary blobs in the
      Neo900 <abbr title="Application Processor
      Environment">APE</abbr>, we consider the chance of a modem bug
      bubbling up to the rest of the system without a way to control
      it and fix it in software negligible.</p>

    <p>Our exclusive Neo900 design is more valuable than ever!</p>

    <p id="note-gta0x" class="footnote">Footnote: from Openmoko Neo
      1973 and FreeRunner, to Golden Delicious GTA04 and maybe the
      upcoming Pyra, and of course Neo900, GTA0x design supports modem
      separation, although not power separation in Neo 1973
      (GTA01). <a href="#anchor-gta0x" title="back to text">^^</a></p>

      The Neo900 team decided to move away from proprietary software
      Eagle and converted its schematics production to the KiCad
      open-source Electronics Design Automation
      (<abbr title="Electronics Design Automation">EDA</abbr>) suite.

    <h3 id="asn1-vulnerability">ASN.1 Vulnerability</h3>

    <p>Lucas Molas of <em>Programa STIC</em> discovered a <cite>Heap
      memory corruption in ASN.1 parsing code generated by Objective
      Systems Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++</cite> potentially affecting
      billions of phone users worldwide.  The proprietary software
      vendor received a bug report via <em>plain text email</em> on
      June, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2016, according to
      the <a href="https://github.com/programa-stic/security-advisories/tree/master/ObjSys/CVE-2016-5080/">CVE-2016-5080</a>
      released on July, 18<sup>th</sup>, 2016 to the public in a
      coordinated release with the vendor.</p>

     <blockquote>Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a technical
       standard and formal notation that describes rules and structures
       for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data in
       telecommunications and computer networking.</blockquote>

     <blockquote>A vulnerability found in the runtime support libraries
       of the ASN1C compiler for C/C++ from Objective Systems Inc. could
       allow an attacker to remotely execute code in software systems,
       including embeded software and firmware, that use code generated
       by the ASN1C compiler. The vulnerability could be triggered
       remotely without any authentication in scenarios where the
       vulnerable code receives and processes ASN.1 encoded data from
       untrusted sources, these may include communications between
       mobile devices and telecommunication network infrastructure
       nodes, communications between nodes in a carrier's network or
       across carrier boundaries, or communication between mutually
       untrusted endpoints in a data network.</blockquote>

     <p>The proprietary software vendor released a hot patch (v7.0.1)
       available upon request to their customers, and will integrate the
       fix in the upcoming v7.0.2 of their compiler.</p>

     <p>On July, 1<sup>st</sup>, Programa STIC mentioned that <q>memory
       corruption bugs in ASN.1 related components of an LTE stack have
       been announced or hinted at in several infosec conference
       presentations over the past few weeks and its likely the same or
         similar bugs will become public soon.</q></p>

     <h4>How is Neo900 Affected?</h4>

     <p>In
       our <a href="https://neo900.org/news/paypal-resumes-neo900-sources-again">last
       communication</a> we noted that <q><strong>Neo900 is the only
       phone that provides a hardware protection from remote activation
       of the baseband chip</strong></q>, making it <strong>immune by
       design</strong> to this class of vulnerability.</p>

     <p>Our exclusive Neo900 design is more valuable than ever!</p>

     <h3 id="more-n900-sourcing">More N900 Sourcing</h3>

     <p>After dowsing for a while, our boots in China confirmed the
       source mentioned previously!  We already received 20 more N900
       units responding to our quality criteria for enduring the
       metamorphosis into brand new Neo900 units for you lucky (and
       patient) early birds.  20 more units are on the way, and we
       expect more to come.  We're already at 70 units and
       counting.</p>

     <p>Again, if you know where to find some affordable stocks of N900
      units,
      please <a href="mailto:contact@neo900.org?Subject=N900%20Stock">contact
         us</a>!</p>

     <h3 id="neo900-whitepapers">Whitepapers Update</h3>

     <p>While we're at it, and to continue building momentum for
       our <a href="#feature">main feature</a> today, like if you were
       too early at the movies, let's have a look at what our mad
       scientists concocted since last June.</p>

     <p>

     <p>You can always follow our whitepapers updates directly from
       Werner in
       the <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=93498">Neo900
       Announcements</a> thread on talk.maemo.org, and access the whole
       up-to-date whitepaper collection from
       the <a href="https://neo900.org/resources">Resources section</a>
       at neo900.org.</p>

     <p>And now, without further ado, our main feature!</p>

     <h3 id="feature">From Eagle to KiCad</h3>

     <p>When Joerg took charge of the Neo900 project, the electronics
       design was made with Eagle, and was updated using that tool ever
       since.  Nikolaus, of OpenPandora fame, was the Eagle virtuoso,
       but our communication with his company, Golden Delicious, was
       hampered for a long time by incompatible tools and workflow.</p>

     <p>In 2016, Nikolaus faded away from Neo900, absorbed by Neo900's
       sister project <a href="https://pyra-handheld.com">Pyra</a>.
       Just a few weeks ago he confirmed that he couldn't follow up on
       the layout for Neo900, which prompted Joerg and Werner to
       consider alternatives.</p>

     <p>In the <abbr title="Electronics Design Automation">EDA</abbr>
       market, besides Eagle, there's Altium.  But Altium has the same
       flaw as Eagle: it's proprietary, and moreover, it's quite
       expensive.  Our rationalizing mind wants to say there's cognitive
       dissonance in using non-free software for a free hardware
       project.  And in hindsight, this sounds like a good
       rationalization.</p>

    <p>Among the open-source alternatives to Eagle (let's leave Altium
      in its own class), <a href="http://fritzing.org/">Fritzing</a>
      didn't match our need for multilayer board support;
      between <a href="http://geda-project.org/">gEDA</a>
      and <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>, the choice was
      easy: the latter is much more popular, backed up
      by <abbr title="Centre Européen de Recherche
      Nucléaire">CERN</abbr> as part of
      the <a href="http://home.cern/about/updates/2015/02/kicad-software-gets-cern-treatment">Open
      Hardware Initiative</a>, and there are discussions to share
      codebase between the two projects [ref needed].</p>

    <h4>How does the move to KiCad influence Neo900 development?</h4>

    <p>The only major downside comes from the reduced access to
      Nikolaus' OMAP know-how, although we hope Nikolaus will be able to
      review our work.  On the other hand, we're no longer slowed down
      by uncertainty with regard to the future role of Golden Delicious
      in Neo900: this caused change requests to pile up, and we used
      white papers as a means of documenting what we couldn't change in
      the schematics in a timely manner.</p>

    <p>That gives us wings: with KiCad, we can now provide a more
      transparent development process and can now operate in a more
      schematics-centric mode, using white papers only where something
      actually needs explaining.</p>

    <p>We found out that KiCad's routing capabilities are superior to
      Eagle's. [anything to add there?] </p>

    <h4>What's the progress on converting Neo900 schematics from Eagle
      to KiCad?</h4>

    <p>Progress is surprisingly fast.  We already completed the bulk of
      the conversion, and are now fixing bugs (some discovered during
      the conversion,
      and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1154131/comments/9">also
        in KiCad</a>.)</p>

    <p>In the coming weeks we're going to work on incorporating material <em>parked</em> in whitepapers (see above), [maybe leave that alone for now:] define the BB-mX interface for prototype v2 (...)</p>

    <p>...</p>

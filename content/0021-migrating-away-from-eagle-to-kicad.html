    <p class="lead">
      The Neo900 team decided to move away from proprietary software
      Eagle and converted its schematics production to the KiCad
      open-source Electronics Design Automation
      (<abbr title="Electronics Design Automation">EDA</abbr>) suite.

    <h3 id="asn1-vulnerability">ASN.1 Vulnerability</h3>

    <p>Lucas Molas of <em>Programa STIC</em> discovered a <cite>Heap
      memory corruption in ASN.1 parsing code generated by Objective
      Systems Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++</cite> potentially affecting
      billions of phone users worldwide.  The proprietary software
      vendor received a bug report via <em>plain text email</em> on
      June, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2016, according to
      the <a href="https://github.com/programa-stic/security-advisories/ObjSys/CVE-2016-5080/">CVE-2016-5080</a>
      released on July, 18<sup>th</sup>, 2016 to the public in a
      coordinated release with the vendor.</p>

     <blockquote>Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a technical
       standard and formal notation that describes rules and structures
       for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data in
       telecommunications and computer networking.</blockquote>

     <blockquote>A vulnerability found in the runtime support libraries
       of the ASN1C compiler for C/C++ from Objective Systems Inc. could
       allow an attacker to remotely execute code in software systems,
       including embeded software and firmware, that use code generated
       by the ASN1C compiler. The vulnerability could be triggered
       remotely without any authentication in scenarios where the
       vulnerable code receives and processes ASN.1 encoded data from
       untrusted sources, these may include communications between
       mobile devices and telecommunication network infrastructure
       nodes, communications between nodes in a carrier's network or
       across carrier boundaries, or communication between mutually
       untrusted endpoints in a data network.</blockquote>

     <p>The proprietary software vendor released a hot patch (v7.0.1)
       available upon request to their customers, and will integrate the
       fix in the upcoming v7.0.2 of their compiler.</p>

     <p>On July, 1<sup>st</sup>, Programa STIC mentioned that <q>memory
       corruption bugs in ASN.1 related components of an LTE stack have
       been announced or hinted at in several infosec conference
       presentations over the past few weeks and its likely the same or
         similar bugs will become public soon.</q></p>

     <h4>How is Neo900 Affected?</h4>

     <p>In
       our <a href="https://neo900.org/news/paypal-resumes-neo900-sources-again">last
       communication</a> we noted that <q><strong>Neo900 is the only
       phone that provides a hardware protection from remote activation
       of the baseband chip</strong></q>, making it <strong>immune by
       design</strong> to this class of vulnerability.</p>

     <p>Our exclusive Neo900 design is more valuable than ever!</p>

     <h3 id="more-n900-sourcing">More N900 Sourcing</h3>

     <p>After dowsing for a while, our boots in China confirmed the
       source mentioned previously!  We already received 20 more N900
       units responding to our quality criteria for enduring the
       metamorphosis into brand new Neo900 units for you lucky (and
       patient) early birds.  20 more units are on the way, and we
       expect more to come.  We're already at XXX units and
       counting.</p>

     <p>Again, if you know where to find some affordable stocks of N900
      units,
      please <a href="mailto:contact@neo900.org?Subject=N900%20Stock">contact
      us</a>!</p>

    <p class="lead">
      The Neo900 team decided to move away from proprietary software
      Eagle and converted its schematics production to the KiCad
      open-source Electronics Design Automation
      (<abbr title="Electronics Design Automation">EDA</abbr>) suite.
    </p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    <p>Before jumping to Neo900 project updates since June, and our main
      feature, we'd like to share with you a recent vulnerability
      disclosure which shows the value of separating the telephony stack
      from the rest of the system.</p>

    <h3 id="asn1-vulnerability">ASN.1 Vulnerability</h3>

    <p>Following the decision of <abbr title="National Institute for
      Standards and Technology">NIST</abbr> to deprecate usage of SMS in
      two-factor authentication (we'll come back on this in an upcoming
      installment), this vulnerability disclosure confirms the interest
      of the unique design of Neo900 that isolates the baseband chip
      from power supply, making it dependent on the <abbr title="Central
      Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> (and the <abbr title="Operating
      System">OS</abbr>) to access anything else on the system, and
      preventing remote activation of the chip in the first place.</p>

    <p>Lucas Molas of <em>Programa STIC</em> discovered a <cite>Heap
      memory corruption in ASN.1 parsing code generated by Objective
      Systems Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++</cite> potentially affecting
      billions of phone users worldwide.  The proprietary software
      vendor received a bug report via <em>plain text email</em> on
      June, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2016, according to
      the <a href="https://github.com/programa-stic/security-advisories/tree/master/ObjSys/CVE-2016-5080/">CVE-2016-5080</a>
      released on July, 18<sup>th</sup>, 2016 to the public in a
      coordinated release with the vendor.</p>

     <blockquote>Abstract Syntax Notation One (<abbr title="Abstract
       Syntax Notation One">ASN.1</abbr>) is a technical standard and
       formal notation that describes rules and structures for
       representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data in
       telecommunications and computer networking.</blockquote>

     <blockquote>A vulnerability found in the runtime support
       libraries of the ASN1C compiler for C/C++ from Objective
       Systems Inc. could allow an attacker to remotely execute code
       in software systems, including embeded software and firmware,
       that use code generated by the ASN1C compiler. The
       vulnerability could be triggered remotely without any
       authentication in scenarios where the vulnerable code receives
       and processes <abbr>ASN.1</abbr> encoded data from untrusted
       sources, these may include communications between mobile
       devices and telecommunication network infrastructure nodes,
       communications between nodes in a carrier's network or across
       carrier boundaries, or communication between mutually untrusted
       endpoints in a data network.</blockquote>

     <p>The proprietary software vendor released a hot patch (v7.0.1)
       available upon request to their customers, and will integrate the
       fix in the upcoming v7.0.2 of their compiler.</p>

     <p>On July, 1<sup>st</sup>, Programa STIC mentioned
       that <q>memory corruption bugs in <abbr>ASN.1</abbr> related
       components of an <abbr title="Long Term Evolution">LTE</abbr>
       stack have been announced or hinted at in several infosec
       conference presentations over the past few weeks and its likely
       the same or similar bugs will become public soon.</q></p>

     <h4>How is Neo900 Affected?</h4>

     <p>The short answer is: Neo900 is not affected.  Keep reading to
       know why.</p>

    <p>In
       our <a href="https://neo900.org/news/paypal-resumes-neo900-sources-again">last
       communication</a> we noted that <q><strong>Neo900 is the only
       phone that provides a hardware protection from remote
       activation of the baseband chip</strong></q>.</p>

    <p id="anchor-gta0x">In fact, the
      <a href="#note-gta0x"><strong>GTA0x</strong> design</a> contains
      two unique features:
      <ul>
        <li>the modem is detached from the power source, unlike other
          smartphones, so that the modem has to be authorized by
          the <abbr>CPU</abbr> before it can perform its tasks.</li>
        <li>the modem and the <abbr>CPU</abbr> <strong>do not share
          <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>, which
          prevents a whole range of attack vectors where a rogue
          baseband chip, either by design, by "lawful" or illegal
          action, could take control of memory segments pertaining to
          other subsystems and inject malicious code.</li>
      </ul>
      Neo900 takes advantage of this and incorporates circuitry to
      give the <abbr>CPU</abbr> the capacity to monitor:
      <ul>
        <li>the modem access to power and its consumption</li>
        <li>the activity of the modem antenna</li>
        <li>the activation of the
          <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>
          part of the modem</li>
        <li>other interfaces (e.g., digital
          <abbr title="Pulse-Code Modulation">PCM</abbr> audio</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Therefore this vulnerability that potentially plagues most
       commercial phones on the planet, won't affect Neo900 like it
       will other devices. In other designs where RAM is shared and a
       rogue modem can access the power supply at will, the attack
       surface is infinitely larger, and exploiting a vulnerability
       such as the <abbr>ASN.1</abbr> bug will grant access to the
       whole system.</p>

    <p>But with Neo900, only a rare combination of hardware
       vulnerability in the <abbr title="Universal Serial
       Bus">USB</abbr> connecting the modem to the <abbr>CPU</abbr>,
       and a software vulnerability would have a remote chance to do
       that. As long as there's no proprietary vulnerable binary blobs
       in the Neo900 <abbr title="Application Processor
       Environment">APE</abbr>, the chance of a modem bug bubbling up
       to the rest of the system without a way to control it and fix
       it in software remains null.</p>

    <p>Our exclusive Neo900 design is more valuable than ever!</p>

    <h3 id="server-migrated">Neo900.org Server Migrated</h3>

    <p>Last week we completed the migration of Neo900.org services,
      including <a href="https://my.neo900.org/">Neo900 Shop</a> to a
      new server.  The old one was running out of space, and
      dangerously approaching capacity, especially
      when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">slashdotted</a>.</p>

    <p>If you encounter any problems with the new server,
    please <a href="mailto:contact@neo900.org?Subject=Neo900.org%20Services%20Issue">report
    them</a>!</p>

    <h3 id="more-n900-sourcing">More N900 Sourcing</h3>

    <p>After dowsing for a while, our boots in China confirmed the
      source mentioned previously!  We already received 20 more N900
      units responding to our quality criteria for enduring the
      metamorphosis into brand new Neo900 units for you lucky (and
      patient) early birds.  20 more units are on the way, and we
      expect more to come.  We're already at 70 units and
      counting.</p>

     <p>Again, if you know where to find some affordable stocks of N900
      units,
      please <a href="mailto:contact@neo900.org?Subject=N900%20Stock">contact
         us</a>!</p>

     <h3 id="neo900-whitepapers">Whitepapers Update</h3>

     <p>While we're at it, and to continue building momentum for
       our <a href="#feature">main feature</a> today, like if you were
       too early at the movies, let's have a look at what our mad
       scientists concocted since last June.</p>

     <p>

     <p>You can always follow our whitepapers updates directly from
       Werner in
       the <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=93498">Neo900
       Announcements</a> thread on talk.maemo.org, and access the whole
       up-to-date whitepaper collection from
       the <a href="https://neo900.org/resources">Resources section</a>
       at neo900.org.</p>

     <p>And now, without further ado, our main feature!</p>

     <h3 id="feature">From Eagle to KiCad</h3>

     <p>When Joerg took charge of the Neo900 project, the electronics
       design was made with Eagle, and was updated using that tool ever
       since.  Nikolaus Schaller, of OpenPandora fame, was the Eagle
       virtuoso, but our communication with his company, Golden
       Delicious, was hampered for a long time by incompatible tools and
       workflow.</p>

     <p>In 2016, Nikolaus faded away from Neo900, absorbed by the
       finishing touch to Neo900's sister
       project <a href="https://pyra-handheld.com">Pyra</a>.  Just a few
       weeks ago he confirmed that he couldn't follow up on the layout
       for Neo900, which prompted Joerg and Werner to consider
       alternatives.</p>

     <p>In the <abbr title="Electronics Design Automation">EDA</abbr>
       market, besides Eagle, there's Altium.  But Altium has the same
       flaw as Eagle: it's proprietary, and moreover, it's quite
       expensive.  Our rationalizing mind wants to say there's cognitive
       dissonance in using non-free software for a free hardware
       project.  And in hindsight, this sounds like a good
       rationalization.</p>

    <p>Among the open-source alternatives to Eagle (let's leave Altium
      in its own class), <a href="http://fritzing.org/">Fritzing</a>
      didn't match our need for multilayer board support;
      between <a href="http://geda-project.org/">gEDA</a>
      and <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>, the choice was
      easy: the latter is much more popular, backed up
      by <abbr title="Centre Européen de Recherche
      Nucléaire">CERN</abbr> as part of
      the <a href="http://home.cern/about/updates/2015/02/kicad-software-gets-cern-treatment">Open
      Hardware Initiative</a>, and there are discussions to share
      codebase between the two projects [ref needed].</p>

    <h4>How does the move to KiCad influence Neo900 development?</h4>

    <p>The only major downside comes from the reduced access to
      Nikolaus' <abbr title="Open Multimedia Applications
      Platform">OMAP</abbr> know-how, although we hope he will be able
      to review our work.  On the other hand, we're no longer slowed
      down by uncertainty with regard to the future role of Golden
      Delicious in Neo900: this used to cause change requests to pile
      up, and we used white papers as a means of documenting what we
      couldn't change in the schematics in a timely manner.</p>

    <p>That gives us wings: with KiCad, we can now provide a more
      transparent development process and can now operate in a more
      schematics-centric mode, using white papers only where something
      actually needs explaining.</p>

    <p>We found out that KiCad's routing capabilities are superior to
      Eagle's:</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCG4daPvuVI">Demo of the KiCad router</a>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Moving to KiCad proved to be quite
    an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5oO6fiyB7o">improvement
    over that</a>.</p>

    <h4>What's the progress on converting Neo900 schematics from Eagle
      to KiCad?</h4>

    <p>Progress is surprisingly fast.  We already completed the bulk of
      the conversion, and are now fixing bugs (some discovered during
      the conversion,
      and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1154131/comments/9">also
        in KiCad</a>.)</p>

    <p>In the coming weeks we're going to work on incorporating
    material <em>parked</em> in whitepapers (see above), [maybe leave
    that alone for now:] define the BB-mX interface for prototype v2
    (...)</p>

    <p>Being able to put our schematics under version control moves us
      away from the Stone Age, into the present.  You can watch the
      evolving contents in our
      <a href="https://neo900.org/git/?p=ee;a=tree">eletronics
      engineering Git repository</a>.</p>

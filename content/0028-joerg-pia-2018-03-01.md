# Neo Life

Congratulations are due to resident project leader Joerg Reisenweber, who
recently joined a new open source, privacy promoting hardware research and
development company by Private Internet Access' parent company. Employment was
negotiated in a way that PIA's parent company would allow him a large minority
of his working time to be paid to work on the Neo900 project on his own terms.
This indirectly supports the project by both ensuring Jeorg is financially
sound, and also that his work does not limit his involvement as leadership in
the project.

Thanks for helping keep our project alive PIA!

PIA would also like to thank Neo900 supporters for staying strong with the
project so long by offering a [special discount][discount] for its VPN.

<h2 class="news-title">Neo900 fundraising campaign has started!</h2>
<p class="text-muted news-date">Oct 30, 2013</p>

<p class="lead">We're thrilled to announce that our fundraising campaign with a goal of <strong>25 000 €</strong> has just started!</p>

<p>The <span class="neo900">Neo900</span> project hasn't been forgotten. We're working very hard in order to make our dream come true, and we still keep in mind our promises
about not working behind the walls. To be able to properly develop bug-free devices, we first need to build prototypes, which are quite expensive. That's why we have launched
<a href="https://shop.goldelico.com/wiki.php?page=Neo900"><strong>a fundraiser</strong> with a goal of <strong>25k EUR</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The fundraiser will actually provide triple purpose, as <strong>your donated money will also serve as a discount on the final device price</strong> and it will give us a feedback about number of interested customers, so we can bring the project forward. The further development will start as soon as the minimal amount needed to proceed arrive.</p>

<p>The level of funding will be available to see in "real time" on our <a href="http://neo900.org/">main page</a>.</p>

<p>To make your decision better justified, we've been also preparing a brochure called <strong><a href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/neo900/downloads/get/neo900-feasibility.pdf">feasibility study</a></strong>, containing exactly what we plan to do and what we consider easy, difficult, or desirable but probably impossible. This way we want to allow anyone interested in the project
to make up their own opinion if the project is really what they want and expect.</p>

<p>We're excited to bring this project forward. Thank you for your support!</p>

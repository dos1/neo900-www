<h2 class="news-title">We've reached our goal!</h2>
<p class="text-muted news-date">Nov 04, 2013</p>

<p class="lead">Our fundraiser campaign turned out to be big success, collecting 25 000 € in less than a week!</p>

<p>Thanks to around hundred of donors, we have finally reached our last goal in the fundraiser. That means that we should be able to make the design production ready and prepare to the shipping of around 200 devices!</p>

<p>We were hoping to be able to reach that goal at the end of the year, but it turned out that the community is much more excited about our project than we initially thought! That's a big responsibility that lies on our shoulders and we promise to do anything possible to not disappoint any of you.</p>

<p>However, <strong>it doesn't mean the end of the fundraiser</strong>. Although we're not specifying any next phase to reach, the donations are still open and the rewards still apply. Why? We decided to follow the momentum and give any late-commers the chance to get the rebate. If it turns out that our goal of 200 devices is too low for the demand, we'll be able to find out how many devices should we produce and request the components in adequate amounts. In layman's terms - the more people donate and want to use their rebate for the device, the cheaper it becomes. For everyone.</p>

<p>Additional funds may also be used for research about providing features or stuff like modular design, upgrades of parts initially supposed to be re-used etc. If we for some reason won't be able to use collected money, it will be refunded.</p>

<p>Thanks to reaching our goal this fast, we should be able to showcase the project on <a href="http://ohsw.org/">OpenPhoenux-Hard-Software-Workshop 2013</a> which takes place in Munich at the end of November. Feel invited!</p>

<p>Last but not least, we would like to say <strong>thank you</strong> once again to everyone who supported or are still going to support our project. It wouldn't be possible without your help!</p>

<p>Let the phoenux fly!</p>
